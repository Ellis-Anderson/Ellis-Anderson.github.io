# About Me

Born in Chicago, Ellis spent his childhood summers exploring the northwoods of the Upper Peninsula with his Aunt and Uncle. After moving to California at the age of 9, Ellis began mountain biking with his new neighbors and eventually joined a junior road cycling team. During his time with the team, Ellis traveled all across California and the US, with trips to Death Valley, Yosemite, Georgia, and Utah.
Ellis attended the University of California, Davis, where he studied Genetics and Genomics. During his free time at University, Ellis became involved with Outdoor Adventures, a student run organization which guides outdoor trips across the western United States. Ellis worked as a rock climbing guide for Outdoor Adventures, and met friends who taught him whitewater kayaking, backpacking and cross-country skiing skills. Having learned his love for nature from his early experiences in the Michigan, Ellis is excited to return to the northwoods and help a younger generation cultivate their respect for the great outdoors.

    <p>Tep-1 is an S. lycopersicum shade avoidance mutant identified by Leslie Herrera during her time with Julin Maloof.
      Julin asked me to continue her analysis when I approached him about an internship position in his lab.
      The analysis involved remapping Heinz reads from a prior experiment against the S. lycopersicum 2.50 genome in an
      attempt to clean up the VCF files Leslie had already generated. </p>

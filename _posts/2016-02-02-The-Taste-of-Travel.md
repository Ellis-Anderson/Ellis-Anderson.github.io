## The Taste of Travel

When I first moved to Sweden, the last thing I thought was that a country famous for potatoes and meatballs would be one of the most influential stops in my culinary journey. Sweden isn’t exactly a place people think of when they talk about fine dining — they think of France or Spain, and souffles or reductions, not fermented herring or cinnamon rolls. Either way, moving to Sweden became a hugely formative experience for my inner chef.

If you’re into food, anywhere can be a food mecca. The love of new tastes and flavor combinations can convince you to try just about anything, and if you’re interested in immersing yourself in culture you can enjoy just about anything.

My culinary experience in Sweden started as soon as my flight landed — after 14 hours on a plane all I was thinking about was food anyways. I immediately grabbed some smörgås (Swedish open faced sandwiches) from a concession stand before making my way to my hotel. The next morning the hotel offered a full Swedish breakfast buffet. They had herring, Swedish cracker-bread, among many other Swedish delicacies.

------------

Everything was delicious and I left feeling filled and exceptionally Swedish, it was perfect. As I checked out of the airport hotel I had a conversation about my breakfast with the hotel clerk. He noted my Swedish last name and the fact that I couldn’t speak Swedish before he asked me my opinion of the food. Naturally, I told him it was delicious and I listed off all the different things I had tried. When I mentioned the herring his face turned white.

“You ate the herring? You know that’s fermented right? If you haven’t eaten that before you can have some serious bowl issues! Sit next to the toilet on the airplane.” He told me. I laughed it off and told him it’d be fine — I’ve got Swedish heritage. Luckily for me, my stomach handled the herring fine and there were no gastrointestinal upsets on my flight.

My culinary exploration of Sweden continued during my immersive language program. I tried all the different street food vendors in Lund, and made some of my own meals. The seafood was the most impressive part. While California is the heart of agriculture and produce, Sweden is a mecca of seafood. Situated in between the Baltic and the Atlantic oceans, just about any seafood you can imagine is readily available from local fishmongers — instead of going to farmers markets every week, I was going to the fish stands once or twice a week. Me and some other Californians tried everything from razor clams to Dungeness crab.

While the street food and local produce, my real culinary journey began with the start of my University classes, but to truly understand that journey I need to give a little background info. Lund Universitet has an exceptionally unique social scene. All students have the option to join a gigantic student union called Student Lund, after which you can join any of 13 different student unions.

These unions are based off of geographic locations in Sweden and date back to the start of the university. Originally the idea was that students from the different areas of Sweden would be able to meet other students from similar areas and therefore similar backgrounds. Now these student unions can be joined by anyone from any of Sweden’s diverse communities, and are distinguished more by the unique aspects of the union than by their geographical regions. For example, I joined Sydskånska Nationen, the south scanian nation, which distinguishes itself by it’s love of music. Other unions bill themselves as an international community or, in classic Swedish fashion, as politically active.

These unions are incredibly supportive student bodies, and offer the framework to develop just about any event you can imagine. Beyond their support, the unions also have weekly events already established and entirely student run. Almost all the unions have clubs with either live music or DJs, while also offering lunches, pubs, cafes and even movie screenings.

The unions themselves are student organized and function almost as companies. Several elected students take a year off to run the entire organization, while other students (also elected) take charge of particular events and organize volunteer labor. As soon as I joined Sydskånska I started volunteering in order to meet Swedish students and get involved with the community.

One of the first events I volunteered for was as a server for a sittning. Sittnings are dinners where student chefs create a three course dinner, which the servers distribute to up to 70 seated guests. The guests sing songs, dance and generally have a great time.

My time as a server was certainly interesting, but it also introduced me to some of the chefs in the back. As I got more involved with the union I started getting closer to the chefs, and ended up volunteering in the back of the kitchen. That night I met one of the people I ended up being closest to, David Frödin. David was a fantastic cook, having learned quite a bit from his mother who worked as a chef. After David and I got to know each other he recommended I try and get a position as a chef for the weekly lunches at the union — I already knew most of the nation members, I’d almost definitely get the position.

A week later I had continued to get to know more of the students at the union and had got the position as chef for the lunches. Three other students got lunch positions as well, among them Hampus Freccero, another close friend I made during my adventures abroad. Hampus also came from a culinary back=ground and had spent 6 years as a chef in Guatemala. We instantly bonded over our mutual love for all things spicy.

While we each had to head a lunch a month, both Hampus and I found ourselves in each others kitchens at every event we headed. Having a chef you can trust in the kitchen makes cooking for 130 people significantly easier. Our first goal was to bring our favorite Latin American cooking styles to our Swedish friends. Hampus made an exceptionally good chili for his first lunch, while my first meal was new Mexican style enchiladas. Both of the meals were received well, though our Swedish friends had some hard times with how spicy the cooking was.

As the weeks went by we continually tried to outdoor ourselves, with Hampus teaching me Swedish culinary main stays, while I tried to introduce Swedes to American style food, including a thanksgiving meal with 5 roast turkeys.

The two of us taught each other new skills, and spending so much time in the kitchen, I finally learned how to really handle a knife and developed a much better sense of taste. Sweden really gave me an opportunity to develop my cooking skills while introducing me to tastes and styles I would never have gotten to try in California.

My culinary journey didn’t stop with my work as a cook, though. Some of my favorite opportunities were outside of the kitchen. One Sittning that David headed goes down as one of the best meals I’ve ever had. David started the dinner with a leek and potato soup, a Swedish classic that I had never particularly liked before. The second course was the real killer though. A south Swedish classic, David had prepared goose breast for everyone. It was truly an incredible culinary experience.

The most memorable meal I had though, was at Gåsafesten ball, or The Goose Ball. Goose is a traditional Scanian delicacy and the Ball, which only occurs every five years, celebrates the splitting of the five Scanian unions. Me and 499 other students, decked out in white tie attire, arrived at a giant castle for our night of festivities. Courses included Goose blood soup, Goose breast, and Key-lime pie (for some reason Swedes love key lime pie), filled with singing, live entertainment and speeches.

-------------

Afterwards the guests enjoyed a fireworks display before enjoying a “second-dinner” of smörgåstårta (sandwich cake), with more dancing to Swedish pop and dancing on tables. We found out later 400 chairs were destroyed throughout the course of the night, and that was before the event opened up to the public.

All in all, my trip to Sweden was hugely memorable. My opportunities in the kitchen there have translated over to my every day life, and I’ve spent time in restaurants and even chefed for some supper clubs at my home university. I expanded and developed my palate, while meeting exceptionally driven and talented individuals. I still count the days until I can buy another plane ticket back to Sweden.
